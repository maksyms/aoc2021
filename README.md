## [Advent Of Code 2021 Fun](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

If you do not know what Advent Of Code is, please follow [this](https://adventofcode.com/) link and read up.

This repository contains solutions for AOC2020 in Rust. You can read the tasks themselves [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Do either `cargo run` or, alternatively, `cargo aoc`, if you are set up for Advent Of Code 2021 correctly.

For setting up `cargo aoc` see [here](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc)

## My Goals

1. I am practicing my (very basic) Rust knowledge.
2. I am figuring out and coding all the solutions myself, without any exceptions and without any peeking into other people's solutions.
3. I am practically reminding myself of the applications of basic Computer Science approaches.
4. I am getting experience using the rich Rust ecosystem - so no re-implementing the basic CS algos, but rather using the existing Rust implementations whenever possible.
5. I am having fun!
